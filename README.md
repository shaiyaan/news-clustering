# News Article Clustering

Text analysis and clustering of news articles using natural language processing techniques.

## Approach
Implemented unsupervised learning techniques to cluster news articles based on content similarity. Applied text preprocessing including tokenization, stop word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization. Utilized K-means clustering to group similar articles and extract key themes. Developed visualizations to represent cluster distributions and common topics within each cluster.

## Core Technologies
- Python for implementation
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Scikit-learn for TF-IDF and K-means clustering
- Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for cluster visualization

## Results
Successfully grouped news articles into distinct clusters, revealing patterns in media coverage and content relationships. Identified key themes and topics within each cluster, providing insights into news content organization.
